# Mounts

Mounts are creatures that Clay Soldiers can ride,
giving them increased mobility and additional advantages in battle.

## Clay Horse

Clay Horses serve as loyal mounts for Clay Soldiers,
allowing them to ride into battle with increased speed.
There are 4 different variants of Horse, Cake, Grass, Snow and Mycelium.
They can be equipped with special [armor](default-items.md#items-for-clay-horse) to provide additional protection.

## Clay Pegasus

Similar to Clay Horses, Clay Pegasi offer the same mobility on the ground,
but with the added ability to fly.
This makes them perfect for aerial combat and gaining a tactical advantage from the skies.

## Rabbits

Clay Soldiers can also ride standard Minecraft rabbits, using them as swift mounts to lead
or engage in battle. Rabbits provide speed and agility,
making them a great option for quickly moving soldiers across the battlefield.
