## Usage

The Clay Pouch can be used to store large amounts of Clay Dolls of one type, like [Clay Soldiers](./soldier-puppet.md) or [Clay Horses](./clay-horses.md).

Items are inserted into pouch by left-clicking, and retrieved by right-clicking.
Items can be retrieved from pouches multiple ways:

* Right-clicking on the pouch in an inventory, without holding anything with the cursor, causes the cursor to hold the item added to pouch.
* Right-clicking on the pouch in an inventory while it is held in the cursor and hovered over an empty slot where the item(s) can be placed causes that item to be placed in that slot.
* When a pouch item on the ground is destroyed, the contents of the pouch are dropped as items, similar to when a bundle is destroyed.

Right-clicking on a Block with the Pouch will release all Clay Doll stored in the Pouch.
Sneeking, release only one Clay Doll.

## Obtaining

Can be obtained by killing any Boss Clay Soldier.
