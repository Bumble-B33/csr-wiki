## 2. Equipping Your Clay Soldiers

Once you have your clay soldiers,
you can arm and equip them with various items by throwing them on the ground nearby.
Your soldiers will automatically pick up items and enhance their abilities based on what they collect.

**Some Basic Equipment**

* Weapons: Throw sticks, blaze rod or bones to arm your soldiers with melee weapons
* Armor: Soldiers can pick up leather or bricks to improve their defense.
* Mounts: You can give them mounts such as [Clay Horse](wiki/items/clay-horses.md) for faster movement.

## 3. Creating Your First Battle

Now that your soldiers are armed and ready, it’s time for battle!

1. Choose a Battlefield: Set up a small arena using blocks.
It can be as simple or complex as you like. Flat spaces work best.

2. Deploy Your Soldiers: Right-click the ground to place your soldiers on the battlefield.
You can deploy multiple teams by crafting soldiers of different colors.

3. Let the Battle Begin: Once soldiers of opposing colors are nearby,
they will automatically start fighting each other. Sit back and watch the battle unfold!
